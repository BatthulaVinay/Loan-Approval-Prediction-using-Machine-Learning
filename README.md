# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various applicant details. It leverages classification models to automate decision-making in the loan approval process, helping financial institutions speed up and standardize their approvals.

## Objectives
- Build a machine learning model for binary classification (Loan Approved: Yes/No)
- Analyze key features that influence loan decisions
- Improve accuracy and reduce bias in prediction

## Dataset
- Typical features include:
  - Gender
  - Married
  - Dependents
  - Education
  - Self_Employed
  - ApplicantIncome
  - CoapplicantIncome
  - LoanAmount
  - Loan_Amount_Term
  - Credit_History
  - Property_Area
  - Loan_Status (Target variable)

## Libraries Used
- Pandas, NumPy — Data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn — Visualization
- Scikit-learn — ML modeling, metrics
- Optional: XGBoost, LightGBM — for model boosting

## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Understand correlations and trends
   - Visualize distributions and feature impact
3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest
   - Train-test split and cross-validation
4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrix and ROC curve

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-approval-prediction.git
   cd loan-approval-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning.ipynb`

## Results
- Achieved solid prediction accuracy on test data
- Credit history and income were strong predictors
- Potential to automate loan approval pipeline with transparency

## Future Work
- Deploy model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
- Integrate explainable AI (SHAP or LIME) for fairness and transparency
- Add more financial or behavioral data for improved accuracy
